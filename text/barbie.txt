 
 
I was 
on 
vacation
 
with 
family 
and 
friends
 
and we 
were 
 
in this 
ski house
 
in Vermont
in Vermont
 
and then 
my Dad 
was like
to me
 
 
whatever you do
don't
don't
 
like
actually
 
DO  
NOT
 
go 
upstairs
 
there's stuff 
up there
 
just
  
DON'T DO IT
DON'T DO IT
 
but like
 
we went 
upstairs 
anyways
lol
 
and 
we tried 
the door
 
but 
we couldn't 
open 
the handle
 
but 
eventually 
we did
 
and 
we opened 
the door
 
and there 
were a
bunch of
 
barbie dolls
barbie dolls 
 
EVERYWHERE
EVERYWHERE
 
and we 
were like
 
OH MY GOD, WHAT
OH MY GOD, WHAT
 
and then
they started 
to 
TALK
 
and 
it was 
pretty creepy
because they 
were 
 
moving around 
and then
they were 
like
 
OH MY GOD
 
THE HUMANS ARE HERE
THE HUMANS ARE HERE
 
and
there were 
just
so many 
 
in that one 
tiny tiny 
 
closet
so yeah
so yeah
 
my friend 
and I 
 
were 
 
uh
 
kind of
freaking 
OUT
OUT
