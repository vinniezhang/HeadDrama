 
 
okay
so 
um 
 
 
there's 
a 
long 
hallway
hallway
 
and
 
it's dark
and
and
 
on the
floor

there's
a flat 
 
escalator
 
you know
you know
 
like the
ones 
in 
 
airports 
 
for 
lazy
people
people
 
and 
this escalator
this escalator
 
is moving
in the
opposite
direction
 
that you
want to 
go in
go in

- no
- no
 
that
you
NEED
NEED
to 
go 
in
 
 
so
basically
 
no matter
how hard 
you try
to
run
run
 
 
you're 
not 
actually
 
moving 
forward
forward
 
and at
the end 
of this  
 
escalator
 
is a
toilet
toilet
toilet
 

which is 
what
you've
been 
 
trying
to reach
to reach
 
but you
can't
can't
 
because
you're just
running
in place
in place

and 
you're
stuck
there
there

and
you 
essentially
never
reach
that
desired
toilet
toilet
 
 
which
 
absolutely
 
SUCKS
SUCKS
SUCKS
SUCKS
 

yeah
yeah
 
 
so
um
 
that 
was 
my 
nightmare
nightmare
 
and
I hope
you
never 
go
through 
what 
I did
 
because 
no 
one 
deserves
that
that
