 
 
so 
I was 
some sort of
soldier
 
 
like someone 
in the 
special force

 
and there 
was a 
war
 
between Britain 
and Germany

 
I think I 
was fighting
for Britain 
 
or maybe 
I was fighting
for Germany

 
I don't
remember
remember
 
but
either way

 
me and my 
fellow soldiers
were being 
hunted
 

in a rainforest
and we were
running 
for our 
 
LIVES
LIVES

	
we were
moving 
super fast

 
like
ZOOM 
  
along this 
narrow bridge
of iron nets
 
and  
 
wire 
entanglements

entanglements

 
it was 
about a 
meter wide

meter wide
 
like
as tall
as a tree
 
just floating

somehow
somehow
  
 
but we were 
moving 
SUPER 
fast
 
 
and they were
about to 
find us


so
we jumped 
off and 
hung onto
 
the bottom of 
the bridge

the bridge
 
 
still moving 
fast

 
when
 
BOOM
 

we’re on a 
mountain
mountain

 
I look up

 
and the 
peak is 
taller than 
anything 
I’ve ever seen

in my
 
LIFE
LIFE
  
and we 
fall into 
the snow

and are
practically 
BURIED 
ALIVE
ALIVE
 
 
and
 
 
the bad guys
 
STILL
STILL
manage to
chase us


 
so we 
dipped
to the
other side
of the
mountain
 
and then

BOOM
BOOM

 
we're back 
in the 
rainforest
rainforest
  
flying 
between 
treetops

 
and then 
there's this 
tall

grey 
tower
 
that 
looks 
like a 
chimney

 
 
and it was
just there

so
 
we go
back 
onto 
the ground

 
 
it's dark 
  
  
and I walk up
to the
tower door 
 
and there's a
small window 
on it

 
so I
tiptoe 
 
to look 
inside

 
and 
 
in the 
middle
 
of the 
room
 
I see

the body

of a 
 
little boy

little boy
 
half buried

under 
the sand
the sand
 
 
:(
:(
:(
 
 
 
that's
the
end
end
