 
 
I think 
it was
7th grade
7th grade

when I had  
a crush
on this 
guy
in my 
class
class
 
and basically
one night
 
I had 
a dream 
that 
me and him 
 
went 
outside 

during 
our class 
break
 
and we
went
onto the 
basketball 
court
or 
something
something
 
and 
I was
watching him
dribble
around 
 
and 
shoot
hoops
hoops
 
you know
you know
 
 
as one does
as one does

 
when 
literally
 
out of
no where
no where
 
the 
basketball
turns
into a 
 
 
brick
brick
 
so 
he's
just 
holding
a 
brick
in his
hands 
 
and 
he's
staring
at
it 
 
for
uh
I don't know
 
a good
minute
or so 
 
  
and then 
 
all 
of
a 
sudden
 
 
he 
literally 
throws 
the 
fricken 
 
brick 
 
at me
at me
 
 
like
like
straight
at 
 
my
  
FACE
FACE
 
 
-_-
-_-
 
 
yeah 
so 
uh
 
 
 
that was my 
dream
dream

and
 
I didn't 
like 
him
anymore 
after that

because
boys
are
 
 
STUPID
STUPID
